# Quora Question Similarity with Siamese Networks #
*Dataset - quora dataset of question pairs*
## Description ##
This project focuses on designing a deep learning model to identify similar questions on the Quora platform. It involves text preprocessing using the NLTK package and employs word embedding techniques. Siamese LSTM networks are leveraged to compare questions, utilizing distance calculation metrics such as Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, and Cosine similarity. The model achieves an accuracy of 81.98% and is implemented using the Flask framework.
